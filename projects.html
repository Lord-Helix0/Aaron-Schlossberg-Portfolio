            <i>Welcome! I'm excited to share the innovative projects that I'm currently working on, alongside my friend & business partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matan-rieger-5151a596/" target="_blank" role="link" aria-label="Link to Matan's LinkedIn profile" style="color: #0000EE"><u>Matan Rieger</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/luna065s/" target="_blank" role="link" aria-label="Link to Luna's Instagram profile" style="color: #0000EE"><u>Luna</u></a>, Alexander Lee, and Ruby Sinder. Together, we are committed to developing a range of entrepreneurial ventures and large projects that combine our passion for entrepreneurship, technology, 3D modeling, and various other topics. Below is an overview of our ongoing and future projects, including the development of a cutting-edge question-and-answer (Q&A) site, a to-scale Hogwarts recreation for Harry Potter fans to visit, and a set of “Backrooms”-related projects. <br> <br>

            Stay tuned for updates as we continue to bring these ventures to life!</i>

        <h3><b><u>Current Projects</u></b>:</h3> 
        <p><b><u>Overview</u></b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mayvene, the Q&A site</strong>: A question-and-answer (Q&A) site that will be designed to improve knowledge-sharing in a more structured and community-driven way. We began working on it in 2021, and while progress has been slow at times, we continue to refine and develop it.</li>
            <li><strong>A visitable Hogwarts building</strong>: A fully immersive, visitable, to-scale Hogwarts building; a place that truly feels like stepping into the wizarding world... not just a theme park attraction or a set tour.</li>
            <li><strong>Backrooms project(s)</strong>: I am fascinated by the idea of “the <i>Backrooms</i>” and am working on a set of <i>Backrooms</i> projects; <i>initially</i> focusing on 3D renders and videos that capture the eerie allure of the Backrooms and other liminal spaces, but the plan for it is to eventually lead to a physical, visitable Backrooms attraction, bringing the concept to life in an interactive and immersive way.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b><u>In-depth</u></b>:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Q&A site</strong>: <br>
            We are in the early stages of developing an innovative question-and-answer (Q&A) platform. Our mission is, “<i>Spreading knowledge, life experiences, and gaining a better understanding of the universe around us</i>”. Our goal is to create a space where users can ask and answer questions. And especially with the rise of AI chatbots nowadays, it's important to have a site like this run by <i>real people</i>, because AI cannot foster a community of shared knowledge, expertise, and different perspectives like real people can, and AI is often prone to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE;"><u>hallucination</u></a>. And we also will have helpful features, utilize techniques to mitigate trolls and spam, and deploy non-paywall nor heavily ad-reliant site revenue techniques to help keep the site alive. <br>

            <strong>To-scale Hogwarts building</strong>: <br>
            In different places in real life with a "Hogwarts" (such as Harry Potter World at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida), you just see the outside and then only a few aspects (a hallway and a few rooms) of the inside; you see the outside, but the inside is basically just a ride and maybe a few rooms at most. And in the UK, there are set tours. <br> <br>

            But what I hope to create is a full, to-scale Hogwarts, with all of the rooms (commons, the Great Hall, the Chamber of Secrets, the Room of Requirement, the secret kitchen, the door with Fluffy the three-headed dog and the trapdoor that leads to the Sorcerer's Stone, etc...) and other things (like the moving stairs (done safely, of course), the spiral staircase to the headmaster's office, the witch statue that leads to Hogsmeade, talking portraits, etc...) as well as a Hagrid's Hut, and all that. <br>

            <strong>Backrooms building</strong>: <br>
            "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><u>The Backrooms</u></a>" is a fascinating fictional place. It has gained traction online in the last few years; It all started with one picture, and people have since made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVAh-MgDVqvDUEq6qDXqORBioE4Yhol_z" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE;"><u>YouTube videos</u></a>, video games, and even books based on it. The Backrooms, along with “liminal spaces”, in general, have gained much popularity lately. People even would want to be able to go to the Backrooms, if it were real. And that is where the idea lies: to eventually create a physical Backrooms building attraction that people can go to and wander and explore. Firstly, my team and I will be crafting virtual 3D renders (which we will make into videos with a story) that we will post on a YouTube channel of ours. And we hope to build up some sort of following that way, and then to eventually shift that traction into being able to put together a physical Backrooms building attraction. <br>

        <p><b><u>Overview</u></b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>YEAN</strong>: The <b>Young Entrepreneurs and Aspirers Network</b> (YEAN) is meant to be a professional network for highly motivated young individuals. We will focus on inclusivity, supporting members in their entrepreneurial endeavors and personal growth. Our mission is to build a community of 'young people' that balances professionalism and friendship, enabling members to connect, collaborate, and succeed together.</li>
            <li><strong>Video game series</strong>: We are planning a two-part video game series, currently in the conceptual stages. This will end up being our first “video game”-related venture, in which we are hoping to create fun, engaging, and immersive gaming experience.</li>

        <h2>Clubs/"Student Organizations"</h2>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <i>I'm currently a student at Muhlenberg College, where the campus has a vibrant student life with a variety of clubs (known as “Student Organizations”, all run by students). I've had the opportunity to start two of my own clubs, 'co-revive' another, serve on the board of one, and be an active member in several others. Below, I'll be sharing my involvement and leadership roles across these campus organizations. <br> <br>

            Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to contribute to and energize these student organizations!</i>

            <strong>The 'Berg Pokémon Club</strong>: <br> 
            I founded and currently am the President of/run the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/berg.pokemon.club/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>Muhlenberg Pokémon Club</b></u></a>, also referred to as the <b>'Berg Pokémon Club</b>, or simply, just the "<b>Pokémon Club</b>" (in the context of Muhlenberg). I formally and officially established the club through a bureaucratic application/presentation process through the college's Student Government Association. I, along with the club's board, organize in-person meetings, for, and about, Pokémon, where we engage in all aspects of the franchise, including the Pokémon video games, the Trading Card Game (TCG), Pokémon Go, Pokémon Showdown, and we even have the original Pokémon board game from the '90s, "<i>Pokémon: Master Trainer</i>", and more. <br>

I formally established the club through an application/presentation process. I, along with the club's board, organize in-person meetings, for, and about, Harry Potter. The club is meant for anyone & everyone, ranging from people who know little about the series and would like to learn, to the best Aurors and dark wizards looking to connect with other Potterheads. <br>

            <strong>The 'Berg Fencing Club</strong>: <br> 
            I 'co-revived' and run/am the President of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/berg.fencing.club/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>'Berg Fencing Club</b></u></a> on campus. The Fencing Club at Muhlenberg has been around for a long time, but after the 2022-2023 academic year, the club's President was a senior and graduated, and nobody took it over, so it wasn't around for a semester. So in the second semester of the 2023-2024 academic year, another fellow student/friend of mine, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryansteremberg/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>Ryan Steremberg</b></u></a>, and I 'co-revived' the club; we brought it back, and re-established it. <br> <br> 

            In the past, Co-Coach <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-mcandrew-8baa27199/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>Paul McAndrew</b></u></a> would come in to help teach, and the then-President & current Co-Coach, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahnkatz/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>Noah Katz</b></u></a> (now a Muhlenberg alum, Class of 2023), would also teach those wanting to learn to fence. Ryan reached out to them both near the beginning of the second semester of the 2023-2024 academic year, and both now come to the Fencing Club again to teach those who want to learn. <br> <br>

            For the Fencing Club, we provide the gear (owned by the club/the college), and we teach fencing, starting with the basics. So, no equipment or experience is needed in order to join the club. It is a low-stakes, high-fun way to learn how to fence, and to fence with others! <br>

But I am the Secretary of the club, so I help with the club's social media and communications, and aid in anything that the President of the club thinks should be done. Board games are provided, and members can also bring their own. The club meets weekly. <br>
